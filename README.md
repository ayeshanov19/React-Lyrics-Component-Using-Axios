## IMPLEMENTATION
1) AXIOS LIBRARY
2) MUSICMATCH DEVELOPER API

AXIOS:

Axios is a library that helps us make http requests to external resources.
In our React applications we often need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web pages.
Command to install axios in react application: npm install axios
Axios will return data in JSON format.
And  In the componentDidMount method(lifecycle method in react), we make a REST API call and set the state to display on UI.
